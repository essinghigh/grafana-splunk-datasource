>This is a hard fork of [efcasado/grafana-plugin-splunk-datasource](https://github.com/efcasado/grafana-plugin-splunk-datasource) as the project has been abandoned for three years. I have updated a significant amount of the repo to the point that it does not have much in common with the original.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the plugin

2. Unzip it in your Grafana's installation plugin directory (`/var/lib/grafana/plugins`)

    ```bash
    tar -zxf essinghigh-splunk-datasource-XXXXX.tar.gz -C YOUR_PLUGIN_DIR
    ```
    
3. As of Grafana v8+ unsigned plugins must be explicitly allowed within Grafana's configuration (`/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`)

    ```allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = essinghigh-splunk-datasource ```
 
## Configuration

The plugin can be configured
by an administrator from Grafana's UI `Configuration --> Datasources --> Add data source`. 

> **NOTE:** By default Splunk's REST API is only available via HTTPS (even if you allow HTTP access on a differen port), usually on: https://splunk:8089
